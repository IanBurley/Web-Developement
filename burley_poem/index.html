                    <p>
                        In a world where shadows creep and fears take flight,
                        Stands a figure of strength, a beacon of light.
                        A hero unyielding, both brave and true,
                        The Man of Steel, with skies of blue.
                    </p>
                    <p>                
                        With a heart of gold and fists of might,
                        He soars through the heavens, a symbol of right.
                        From the city's depths to the highest peak,
                        He defends the innocent, the weak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born of Krypton's distant star,
                        He bears the weight of a world's scars.
                        A legacy forged in the crucible of fate,
                        He rises above, love and justice his trait.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His cape billows in the winds that gust,
                        A guardian's touch, in him we trust.
                        A fortress of solitude, his hidden retreat,
                        Contemplating a destiny so bittersweet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet battles rage, foes emerge anew,
                        Challenges that only the brave can undo.
                        With unwavering valor, he stands the test,
                        In the S-shielded emblem, we find rest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the darkest nights and days so bright,
                        The Man of Steel fights the endless fight.
                        A symbol of hope, a beacon of might,
                        Guiding us through the darkness, into the light.
                    </p>
